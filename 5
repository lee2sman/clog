[4manti-capitalist software license[0m

Tonight Everest posted that they worked with Ramsey Nasser to create the Anti-Capitalist Software License. https://anticapitalist.software/

I like this idea and incidentally had been writing about free vs open source recently and writing about how their implementation is so similar but that the ethos was different. I was diving into different copyleft licenses to find one that spoke to me. I usually choose GPL or recently AGPL but none of these have the artistic/non-hierarchical/anti-capitalist stance. So Ramsey and Everest's license is a welcome addition. I had been looking at kopimi (not really a license but an idea), the DWTFYWT (do-what-the-fuck-you-want-to license), and others, but still hadn't been particularly moved by any, and had thought about writing my own. Now I have something that speaks to me.

The license is overall quite short, but here's the main takeaway: You can use the code published with the license for use, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distribution of reworked code as long as you are a: solo user or if you are an organization you must be a non or not-for-profit, shared-profit org, or equal worker-owned orgs. And you must not be military, law or employed by such. 

At this point the page with the code is short. I think some promo pages/images/flyers could be made to help promulgate the idea. It's time has come. And I'd love to see a movement based around these ideas grow, especially among those publishing code on major repositories like github. I'll try to start using this license and spreading the idea.
