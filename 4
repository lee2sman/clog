[4mhello clog[0m

Hello world, or at least, a very tiny world.

This is an instance of an idea devised by James Chip that he calls a clog, a lightweight blog you access via running the curl command in the Terminal. It's lightweight in terms of lines of code, amount of software required, and bandwidth. In addition to this experimental clog I have a blog called Nosebook that I host on my website. I'll try doing some different things here. I'm assuming an extremely-small reader community but who knows, this only took a few minutes to get started.

And I think that's what I like about it. It's lightweight also in terms of mindspace or distance from idea to getting it written down and then quote-unquote published. I was about to say it's as easy as twitter where you just type some words into a box and hit a button to publish as a tweet. But of course you have to open your browser, sign into twitter and make sure your words fit within the constraints, and then after all that it washes away in the stream of tweets. This isn't that at all. This is a small note now, but there will be more.

If you'd like to start a clog, you can visit James' page on github and then clone it to your computer https://github.com/jameschip/clog or use mine: https://github.com/lee2sman/clog You should probably delete all the number files, as those are our prewritten clog posts. Then you have to make the new.sh file executable, just once. chmod +x new.sh In the future, run ./new.sh and it will ask you for a clog post name and then you can type your clog post in that file. Perhaps James will change the specification. Who knows? Join in, it's an experiment now.
